This repository contains the source templates used for email platforms used by the developers.redhat.com team.

The developers.redhat.com-email-templates project operates on the "fork and pull request model". That is you should fork this repository into your own GitHub account and then raise changes on the main repository via pull requests.

There is no development environment for this project this is simply for storing version controlled template files for any email platform.

Folder structure is a folder for each email platform e.g. ‘Taxi’ then sub folders for template types as needed.

# Taxi Specific
When changing the taxi master template test buy uploading to the 'Developers Draft Template' then test using the email at https://redhat.emailcms.net/mailings/1187590, this is a testing email linked to the 'Developers Draft Template'.

Once the template has been tested and reviewed by the requestor and a member of the development team it can be merged.

Once merged the template can be copied into the 'Developers Master Template' in the taxi admin interface.
